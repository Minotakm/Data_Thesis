# Data_Thesis

Welcome to the **Data_Thesis** repository! This repository contains the Density of States (DOS) and Bandstructure Plots (BANDS) data generated as part of Chapter 6 in the thesis titled "Design of Novel Magnetic Materials with the use of Machine Learning and High-Throughput Techniques".

## Folder Structure
The data is organized into the following structure:

- **DOS**: Contains Density of States (DOS) plots.
  - **AF1**: Antiferromagnetic Configuration 1.
  - **AF2**: Antiferromagnetic Configuration 2.
  - **Tetragonal**: Tetragonal Distorted Structures.

- **BANDS**: Contains Bandstructure  plots.
  - **AF1**: Antiferromagnetic Configuration 1.
  - **AF2**: Antiferromagnetic Configuration 2.
  - **Tetragonal**: Tetragonal Distorted Structures.



## File Naming Convention DOS
The files follow a naming convention that provides information about each plot:
- Format: `Total_Dos_[Compound].T0001/2.[Prototype].[Metal/Not-metal].png`

## File Naming Convention BANDS
The files follow a naming convention that provides information about each plot:
- Format: `Bands_[Compound].T0001/2.[Prototype].png`

For example: `Total_Dos_HgMn_pvPd_pv.T0001.ABC2_metal` corresponds to the compound Pd2Mn1Hg1 and is calculated to be a metal.
